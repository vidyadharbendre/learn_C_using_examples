#include <stdio.h>

// The # symbol at the beginning of the line indicates a preprocessor directive.
// Preprocessor directives are used for text manipulation before the actual compilation.

// The 'include' directive is used to include the content of a file in the source code.
// In this case, we are including the standard input-output header file, stdio.h.

int main() {
    // This is a simple C program that serves as a template.
    // You can add your code here to achieve your desired functionality.
    // Make sure to provide clear and meaningful comments to explain your code.

    // The 'int' keyword is used to declare an integer data type.
    // In this case, it's used to declare the return type of the 'main' function.

    // The 'main' function is the entry point of the program.
    // All C programs must have a 'main' function where execution begins.

    // Rest of the code...



    // Return 0 to indicate successful execution.
    return 0;
