    Purpose:
    This program demonstrates a simple assignment using the ternary operator.

    Description:
    The program assigns `assign_result` with the greater value of `x` or `threshold` based on a comparison.

    Explanation:
    - If `x` is greater than `threshold`, `assign_result` is assigned `x`; otherwise, it is assigned `threshold`.

    assign_result = (x > threshold) ? x : threshold;

    printf("Assignment result: %d\n", assign_result);
    return 0;
