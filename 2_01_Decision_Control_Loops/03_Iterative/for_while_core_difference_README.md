## Introduction to Loops

Loops allow repetitive execution of code until a specified condition is met. In C, the most commonly used loops are:

- `for`: Ideal for fixed iteration counts.
- `while`: Ideal for dynamic conditions where the number of iterations isn't known upfront.

## What is a `for` Loop?

The `for` loop is a control structure that executes code a predetermined number of times. Its structure consists of:

- **Initialization**: Sets the starting point of the loop.
- **Condition**: Determines if the loop should continue.
- **Increment/Decrement**: Updates the loop variable after each iteration.

### Syntax

```c
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
    // Code to execute
}
```
## Example: Iterating Over a Range

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
### output
```c
Iteration 1
Iteration 2
Iteration 3
Iteration 4
Iteration 5
```

## What is a while Loop?
The while loop executes code as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. It is more flexible than a for loop for dynamic or indefinite iterations.

### Syntax
```c
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}

```
### Example: User Input Until a Condition is Met
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter numbers (enter -1 to stop):\n");
    while (1) {
        scanf("%d", &num);
        if (num == -1) {
            break;
        }
        printf("You entered: %d\n", num);
    }
    return 0;
}

```

## Key Differences

| Feature                  | `For` Loop                              | `While` Loop                             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Iterations** | Known beforehand                       | Not known beforehand                     |
| **Condition Complexity** | Simple, usually a counter              | Complex, involving multiple variables    |
| **Infinite Loops**       | Possible but less common               | More natural for infinite loops          |
| **Flexibility**          | Rigid (counter-based iterations)       | More flexible for dynamic scenarios      |
| **Common Use Case**      | Fixed iteration count (e.g., arrays)   | Dynamic conditions (e.g., event loops)   |

## When to Use a while Loop
Scenarios
Indeterminate Number of Iterations: Example: Processing user input until a termination value is entered.

Waiting for a Condition: Example: Polling for an external event like a sensor value or a specific time.

Infinite Loops: Example: Running a server that waits for client requests.

Complex or Dynamic Conditions: Example: Game logic that involves multiple exit conditions.

### Examples
User Input Example
Use Case: Accept user input until a specific value is entered.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter numbers (enter -1 to stop):\n");
    while (1) {
        scanf("%d", &num);
        if (num == -1) {
            break;
        }
        printf("You entered: %d\n", num);
    }
    return 0;
}

```

### Waiting for a Condition
Use Case: Wait until a timer completes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    time_t start = time(NULL);
    printf("Waiting for 5 seconds...\n");

    while (time(NULL) - start < 5) {
        // Busy-wait
    }
    printf("5 seconds have passed!\n");
    return 0;
}

```

### Infinite Loops
Use Case: A basic server simulation.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int running = 1;
    while (running) {
        printf("Server is running... Press 0 to stop.\n");
        scanf("%d", &running);
    }
    printf("Server stopped.\n");
    return 0;
}

```

### Complex Conditions
Use Case: Game logic with multiple conditions.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int lives = 3;
    int timer = 10;

    while (lives > 0 && timer > 0) {
        printf("Playing... Lives: %d, Timer: %d\n", lives, timer);
        lives--;   
        timer--;
    }

    if (lives == 0) {
        printf("Game Over! You ran out of lives.\n");
    } else if (timer == 0) {
        printf("Time's up! Game Over.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

```
